# Transfer-Learning-for-Emotion-Analysis-in-Bantu-Languages
Evaluating Transfer Learning for Multilabel Emotion Classification in Bantu Languages using AfriBERTa and XLM-R

This project endeavors to address the crucial task of multilabel emotion classification, a nuanced undertaking that captures the simultaneous presence of multiple emotions within text. Recognizing the limitations posed by the scarcity of annotated datasets for these languages, this research proposes a novel approach: the systematic evaluation of transfer learning effectiveness. Specifically, it seeks to determine how effectively pre-trained multilingual models, namely AfriBERTa and XLM-R, can be fine-tuned to accurately discern and classify multiple emotions in isiZulu, isiXhosa, and Kiswahili.

By pursuing this investigation, the project aims to contribute significantly to the development of culturally relevant and linguistically aware NLP applications, thereby bridging a critical gap in African language technology.
